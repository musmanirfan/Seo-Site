            than 200
            Google ranking factors that determine a website's ranking in the search engine listings, the overall purpose

                        information required for a SEO
                        site audit, and then some. This report pointed out some metrics and server vulnerabilities that
                        other audit companies (WooRank, SEO Powersuite, iBusines Promoter) just did not mention. The web
                        interface for the reporting is great, simple and easy to use. Reports are saved in the portal
                        for
                        later use, which is also great. Overall, I think this product looks great and I plan to use it
                        as
                        the main bulk of my SEO auditing as a SEO consultant.</p>
